 Let Mycroft brighten your day with a little humor

## About 
Brighten your day with a little humor.  This draws on the jokes collected by the [PyJokes project](https://github.com/pyjokes/pyjokes) to give you a chuckle.
 
 The joke categories are:
 * Neutral -- jokes that are safe for work, kids or your grandmother
 * Adult -- nothing horrible, but be ready to cover some ears
 * Chuck Norris -- jokes only a geek can love
 
 By default it will give you clean and/or geeky jokes, but you can ask a little adult humor if you feel that way.  
 
 _WARNING:  Laughter is not guaranteed, but eye rolls are likely._

## Examples 
* "Make me laugh"
* "Tell me a joke"
* "Tell me a Chuck Norris joke"
* "I want to hear a raunchy joke"
* "How about a neutral joke"
